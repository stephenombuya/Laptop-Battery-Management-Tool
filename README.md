## üîã Features

- Automatic monitoring of battery charge levels
- Smart charging control to prevent overcharging
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Customizable charging thresholds
- Desktop notifications for battery events
- Detailed logging system for monitoring and debugging
- Manufacturer-specific charging control support

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Administrative privileges (for charging control)
- Compatible laptop with charging control capabilities

## ‚ö° Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stephenombuya/Laptop-Battery-Management-Tool
cd laptop-battery-manager
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
# For Windows
pip install psutil win10toast

# For Linux/macOS
pip install psutil
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Basic usage with default settings:
```bash
python battery_manager.py
```

2. Configure custom charging thresholds by modifying the initialization:
```python
manager = BatteryManager(max_charge_limit=80, min_charge_limit=20)
manager.run()
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool can be configured by adjusting the following parameters:

- `max_charge_limit`: Maximum battery percentage before charging is disabled (default: 80%)
- `min_charge_limit`: Minimum battery percentage when charging notification is triggered (default: 20%)
- `check_interval`: Time between battery checks in seconds (default: 300 seconds)

## üîß Manufacturer-Specific Setup

### Lenovo Laptops
```python
# Example for Lenovo ideapad
subprocess.run(['echo', '0', '>', '/sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode'])
```

### Dell Laptops
```python
# Implementation varies by model
# Refer to Dell Command Configure documentation
```

### HP Laptops
```python
# Implementation varies by model
# Refer to HP BIOS Configuration Utility documentation
```

## üìù Logging

The tool maintains a detailed log file (`battery_manager.log`) containing:
- Battery status changes
- Charging events
- Error messages
- System notifications

Example log entry:
```
2025-01-20 14:30:15 - INFO - Battery Manager started
2025-01-20 14:30:15 - INFO - Battery reached 80%. Disconnecting charging.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Hardware Compatibility**: 
   - Not all laptops support programmatic charging control
   - Manufacturer-specific implementations may be required
   - Some features may require BIOS/UEFI support

2. **Safety Considerations**:
   - Test thoroughly before regular use
   - Monitor battery behavior during initial setup
   - Keep default charging thresholds unless specifically needed

3. **Permissions**:
   - Administrative privileges required for charging control
   - System-level access needed for hardware interaction

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **No Battery Detected**
   - Verify psutil installation
   - Check system permissions
   - Ensure battery is properly connected

2. **Charging Control Not Working**
   - Verify admin privileges
   - Check manufacturer-specific implementation
   - Confirm hardware support for charging control

3. **Notifications Not Showing**
   - Verify notification package installation
   - Check system notification settings
   - Ensure proper permissions
